# MAG Directory

This directory contains the Magic layout file for the CF_SRAM_8192x32 macro.

## Expected File

- `CF_SRAM_8192x32.mag` - Magic format layout file

## Generation

This file should be generated from the physical layout design. Magic is a VLSI layout tool that uses this format for:
- Layout editing
- Design rule checking (DRC)
- Layout vs. schematic (LVS) verification
- Netlist extraction

## Reference

See `CF_SRAM_4096x32/mag/CF_SRAM_4096x32.mag` for the equivalent file in the 16KB SRAM macro.
