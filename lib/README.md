# LIB Directory

This directory contains the Liberty timing library file for the CF_SRAM_8192x32 macro.

## Expected File

- `CF_SRAM_8192x32.lib` - Liberty format timing library

## Generation

This file should be generated from post-layout timing analysis. It provides:
- Timing characteristics (setup, hold, propagation delays)
- Power consumption data
- Capacitance information
- Operating conditions (voltage, temperature, process corners)

## Reference

See `CF_SRAM_4096x32/lib/CF_SRAM_4096x32.lib` for the equivalent file in the 16KB SRAM macro.
