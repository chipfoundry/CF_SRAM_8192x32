# Documentation Directory

This directory contains visual documentation for the CF_SRAM_8192x32 macro.

## Expected Files

- `symbol.jpg` - Symbol diagram showing the macro's interface
- `timing_diagram.jpg` - Timing diagram showing signal relationships

## Generation

These files are typically created manually or from design documentation tools. They provide:
- Visual reference for the macro's pinout
- Timing relationships between signals
- Helpful for integration and understanding the macro's behavior

## Reference

See `CF_SRAM_4096x32/doc/` for the equivalent files in the 16KB SRAM macro.
