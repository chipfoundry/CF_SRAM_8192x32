# GDS Directory

This directory contains the GDSII layout file for the CF_SRAM_8192x32 macro.

## Expected File

- `CF_SRAM_8192x32.gds` - GDSII format layout file

## Generation

This file should be generated from the physical layout design. It contains the complete geometric information needed for:
- Physical verification (DRC/LVS)
- Mask generation for fabrication
- Integration into larger chip designs

## Reference

See `CF_SRAM_4096x32/gds/CF_SRAM_4096x32.gds` for the equivalent file in the 16KB SRAM macro.
